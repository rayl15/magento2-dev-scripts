# magento2-dev-scripts
A couple of simple shell scripts I use for performing common Magento 2 tasks.

## Synopsis

### code.sh
Upgrades the database and runs code generation.

### design.sh
Deploys static view files.

### production.sh
Puts the store in production mode, upgrades the database, runs code generation, deploys static view files, reindexes everything, and flushes the cache.
